- Design Patterns with JAVA

## Design Patterns 🍬

A **design pattern** in software development is a general and reusable solution for a common problem encountered during software design and implementation. Think of it as a plan or a recipe that you can follow to solve a specific type of problem in your code.

These patterns have been identified, documented, and refined over time by experts in the field of software development. They are valuable because they offer a proven and effective way to address recurring problems, which can save time and effort in the development process.

There are various types of design patterns, but the main ones are divided into three categories:

1. **_Creational Patterns_**: These patterns focus on flexible and efficient object creation. For example, the Singleton pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance throughout the application, while the Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that are created.
2. **_Structural Patterns_**: These patterns deal with class and object composition to form larger structures. For example, the Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together, the Decorator pattern adds functionality to objects dynamically, and the Composite pattern composes objects into tree structures to represent hierarchies.
3. **_Behavioral Patterns_**: These patterns focus on object communication and responsibility assignment. For example, the Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Another example is the Strategy pattern, which defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating them and making them interchangeable.

Design patterns **are not definitive solutions to all problems**, and it's important to apply them judiciously and consider the specific context of each situation. However, understanding and using these patterns can help you write _cleaner_, more _flexible_, and _maintainable_ code in your software development projects.

## Structural Design Patterns

Deal with how classes and objects are arranged or composed.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Decorator
- Composite
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy
